This test is comprised of a practical part as well as a theoretical part. In the first part,
one must fill in the missing implementation for all functions, extensions or classes  
located under `lib/src` folder. More details are provided as documentation.

In order for one to be sure he or she succeeded in the first part, all unit tests must pass.

For the second part, one must answer various questions regarding broad topics about the Dart programming language, Flutter and Computer Science. This assessment should not take longer than 4 hours.

Good luck.
